# Building-Web-APIs-with-Flask

This repo contains the app built following the Building Web APIs with Flask course by Gergo Bogdan on Lynda.com.

# Setup

Create a folder for the project (or clone the repo). Create a `venv` folder and initialize Virtualenv in this folder:

```
mkdir venv
virtualenv venv/
```

All the necessary tools will be installed:

`Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.`

Let's activate the virtual environment, now:

`source venv/bin/activate`

Now we can install Flask using pip:

`pip install flask`
